# Karachi AQI Forecasting – End-to-End MLOps Pipeline
An end-to-end MLOps-based Air Quality Index (AQI) forecasting system designed to monitor and predict air quality levels for Karachi, Pakistan.
The project integrates real-time data ingestion, automated feature engineering, model training, deployment, and visualization using modern MLOps tools.

# Project Overview
This project implements a fully automated machine learning pipeline that:
•	Continuously collects real-time and historical AQI & weather data.
•	Performs data preprocessing and feature engineering.
•	Stores engineered features in a Hopsworks Feature Store.
•	Automatically retrains the model using GitHub Actions.
•	Serves predictions through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.
The system provides live AQI monitoring and 72-hour air quality forecasts.

# Data Sources
## 🌫️ Air Quality Data
•	**Source**: OpenWeatherMap Air Pollution API
•	**Data**: AQI levels and pollutant concentrations
    o	PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO₂, SO₂, O₃
•	**Frequency**: Real-time updates
## 🌦️ Meteorological Data
• **Source**: Open-Meteo Historical Archive
• **Features** :
•	Temperature
•	Wind speed
•	Humidity
•	Atmospheric pressure

# Machine Learning
•**Model Used:** Random Forest Regressor
•**Prediction Target:** AQI Level (1–5 scale)
•**Evaluation Metrics:**
o	RMSE
o	MAE
o	R² Score
The best-performing model is automatically registered and fetched from the model registry.

# MLOps & Automation
## 🔹 Feature Store
•	**Tool:** Hopsworks
•	Stores cleaned and engineered features
•	Automatically validates schema using input_example
## 🔹 CI/CD Automation
•	**Tool**: GitHub Actions
•	**Feature Pipeline:**
o	Runs every hour to ingest fresh data
•**Training Pipeline:**
o	Runs daily to retrain and register the best model

# Dashboard (Streamlit)
**🔗 Live App:** https://10pearlsaqiproject-x44hvmjyqmc3qohlndqqrf.streamlit.app/
**Dashboard Features:**
•	Live AQI status with health category
•	72-hour AQI forecast visualization
•	Pollutant concentration breakdown
•	Past 30 days AQI distribution
•	Model performance metrics
•	Health recommendations based on AQI level

# Tech Stack
